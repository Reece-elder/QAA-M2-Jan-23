# Python is a dynamically typed scripting language
# In ANY languages (that support comments), these lines are not read by an interpreter 
# Used for information to other devs 

# Dynamically typed - 
# Variable is a placeholder of data

# the variable called name is a String
# String name = "reece"
name = "reece" # At the minute this is a STRING 
name = 123     # The type of a variable is dynamically read by the interpreter and can change

# Outputs the content in the () to the terminal, so we can read it
print(name)
