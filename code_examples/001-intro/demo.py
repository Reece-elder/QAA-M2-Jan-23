# Python is a dynamically typed scripting language
# In ANY languages (that support comments), these lines are not read by an interpreter 
# Used for information to other devs 

# Dynamically typed - 
# Variable is a placeholder of data

# the variable called name is a String
# String name = "reece"
name = "reece" # At the minute this is a STRING 
name = 123     # The type of a variable is dynamically read by the interpreter and can change

# Outputs the content in the () to the terminal, so we can read it
print(name)

# Python is primarily a scripting language that 'typically' reads a file from top to bottom
print(5)
print(1)
print(2)
print("Hello world")

# Python is dynamically typed meaning you don't need to explicitly specify type
string = "Red"
boolean = True # False
int = 123
float = 1.23

# Arrays, collect data - tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets
favFruits = ["Mango", "Kiwi", "Banana"] # List

# print(boolean)
# print(int)
# print(float)
# print(string) Ctrl + / 
print(favFruits) # array.atObject <efef83e93038fef>

# Naming conventions and best practice
# variable names should only contain abcABC123 _ $
# percentage% = 30 
# last name = "no spaces allowed"
# money$ = 1234
# print = "a4 paper"
GLOBAL_VARS = "ALL UPPERCASE AND _"
camelCase = "my favourite"
snake_case = "not my fav"

# Inputs - Allow the user (us) to enter data into our python code
# Python is typically a language designed for Devs to use to help with other tools
